We made ReactGrid to compose your view with arbitrary cell order. In many components and tools in React ecosystem you have to
keep the same data schema in all rows. Our component breaks out from the frame. 

Today we will show you how to build liquidity planner - an app that provides strategy for financial planning in a long term.
Our app will provide entering, aggregating and evaluating planned cash flows. 

In the Internet you can find many spreadsheets files that are used by e.g. accountants and financial analyst -
one of them as inspiration will be moved from spreadsheet to standalone, fully **reactive** React.js app. 
We also visualize common parameters that helps in decision making wuth the Chart.js library.

## Why do this ?



## Planning app with ReactGrid

Before we starting coding we will tak about good practices that helps to make predictable app. Obviously it's a good idea
to apply them in all projects:

1. Separate the data from ReactGrid

  Main concept of **reactivity** is updating your view every time that your data changes. 
  Very often we have no influence on the data structure, but we can map then to structure that is the most convinient for us. 
  Before the data will become acceptable by ReactGrid or Chart.js we have to calculate a few variables in a repeatable way.
  This data lives only for a moment and should be independent from data and ReactGrid internal interfaces like `Column` and `Row`.
  
  ### wykres render

  Don't do that ⚠️

  ```ts
    import * as React from "react";
    import { ReactGrid, Row } from "@silevis/reactgrid";

    const LiquidityPlanner: React.FC = () => {
      const [rows, setRows] = React.useState<Row[]>(() => getReactGridRows());
      return (
        <>
            ...
        </>
      );
    };
  ```

2. Apply changes directly to data

  ReactGrid constain it's own encapsulated state to manage many invisible functionalities like virtual scrolling or rendering optimizations. 
  This state is based on `rows` and `columns` - two necessary ReactGrid props. ReactGrid is read-only until you define
  your own changes handling function. After that cycle of **reactivity** concept is completed.
