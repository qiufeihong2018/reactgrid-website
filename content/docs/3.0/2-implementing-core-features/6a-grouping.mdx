#### Idea of grouping rows/columns

Grouping is a feature that lets you to create tree-like structure. In a contrast to other datagrid components, this structure 
is defined and stored by cell (not by a row or a column). So if you want to create tree-like structure you can use out built-in 
cell template - [`GroupCell`](/docs/3.0/4-cell-templates/5-GroupCell/).

In the ReactGrid every row and column should have its own unique identity described by [`Id`](/docs/3.0/7-api/1-types/4-id/)
interface. 

We don't know how you compose your cell-matrix so we limited this cell's interface to the minimum necessary.

[`GroupCell`](/docs/3.0/4-cell-templates/5-GroupCell/) can be placed anywhere and can manage multiple rows/columns at once.

#### Example app

At the beginning lets define some data to display. This data will be already compatible with the ReactGrid model. 
In many cases you will have to map your data before.

```ts
/* columns.ts */
import { Column } from "@silevis/reactgrid";

export const columns = (reorderable: boolean, resizable: boolean): Column[] => [
  { columnId: "id", reorderable, resizable, width: 150 },
  { columnId: "hash", reorderable, resizable, width: 400 }
];
```

```ts
/* rows.ts */
import { Row } from "@silevis/reactgrid";

const height = 25;

export const headerRow: Row = {
  rowId: "header",
  reorderable: false,
  height,
  cells: [
    { type: "header", text: `` },
    { type: "header", text: `hash` }
  ]
};

export const rows = (reorderable: boolean): Row[] => [
  {
    rowId: 1,
    height,
    reorderable,
    cells: [
      { type: "group", text: "1", isExpanded: true },
      { type: "text", text: "e989109363ec42610966f85fe9b065e6017058f7" }
    ]
  },
  {
    rowId: 2,
    height,
    reorderable,
    cells: [
      { type: "group", text: "2", isExpanded: true, parentId: 1 },
      { type: "text", text: "ey5seefv1o8soch1q50ztl30bzhubtb1xg6oklup" }
    ]
  },
  {
    rowId: 3,
    height,
    reorderable,
    cells: [
      { type: "group", text: "3", isExpanded: false },
      { type: "text", text: "u61x66unzgl9xd5gre3bj7g8za8cb7ve4t7otz0e" }
    ]
  },
  /* ... */
];
```

`rows` variable in the listing above contains a list of predefined rows. Each row contains array of cells, one of them is marked as 
a `group` which contains necessary data to create our tree of rows. In this sample cells `parentId` field refers to `rowId`.

Due to grouping logic have to be completely implemented by the developer, we:

1. Create logic that is responsed to process current state:
  - finding parent rows,
  - finding [`GroupCell`](/docs/3.0/4-cell-templates/5-GroupCell/) inside each row,
  - getting expanded rows,
  - assigning `indent` and `hasChildren` property.
2. To create collapsible rows we need to introduce two `useState` hooks:
  - `state` with contains all of the rows and columns,
  - `rowsToRender` with contains rows that can be rendered (we don't want to remove rows from `state` but only filter
  them).
3. Handling changes:
  - refreshing `state`s rows (its [`GroupCell`](/docs/3.0/4-cell-templates/5-GroupCell/)'s),
  - appending "static" header row,
  - filtering rows by [`GroupCell`](/docs/3.0/4-cell-templates/5-GroupCell/)'s' `isExpanded` field.

We created an example application, with has already implemented all necessary functions mentioned above.
