import { ReactGrid } from "@silevis/reactgrid";



ReactGrid introduces a brand new feature called *group Id*. The main purpose of it is preventing queueing changes  
by marking cells on `groupId` property using [`Id`](/docs/3.0/7-api/1-types/4-id/) interface.

Marked cell with a `groupId` has a following behavior. While you pasting data or finish fill handle action: change be will 
be queued only for cell with the same `groupId`. If change can't be queued then you will be warned in browser's console.
Even if any cell is not marked then they are treated as separate group.

Every cell with declared `groupId` renders with additional `span` element (containing its value) inside cell if 
you have  passed  `enableGroupIdRender` property:

```tsx
<ReactGrid
    {...props}
    enableFillHandle
    enableRangeSelection
    enableGroupIdRender // highlight-line
/>
```

`groupId` property is available in every cell template because its provided by [`Cell`](/docs/3.0/7-api/0-interfaces/4-cell/)
interface. 

#### Live example

An example shows that a few cells were marked with `group: A` and `group: B` *group Id*.
Have a try select any range and then copy and paste or use fill handle to clone data.
