#### About fill handling in ReactGrid

ReactGrid supports fill handle action, but it is disabled by default. To turn it on you have to simply
add `enableFillHandle` property to `ReactGrid` component.

```tsx
<ReactGrid
    {...props}
    enableFillHandle //highlight-line
/>
```

Note that if an incoming change will not be handled by the app, then there will be no visible changes, 
though the action was correctly performed.
