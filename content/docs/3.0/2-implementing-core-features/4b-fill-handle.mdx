ReactGrid supports fill handle action in PRO version, but it is disabled by default. To turn it on you have to simply
add `enableFillHandle` property `ReactGrid`'s component.

```tsx
<ReactGrid
    {...props}
    enableFillHandle //highlight-line
/>
```

Take notice if an incoming change will be not handled by the app then there will be no visible changes, 
though the action was correctly performed.
