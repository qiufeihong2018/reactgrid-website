## About ReactGrig embedding, virtual scrolling and sticky panes pinning

ReactGrid isn't limited by height and width so it's behavior can change a little bit depending on his scrollable parent element.

ReactGrid appends scroll event to his first scrollable parent and lets himself to expand to full height/width with 
continous observing available viewport to render content of scrollable range and stickies. 

Appeding to `ReactGrid` parent's component css class listed below will change behavior of pinned sticky panes.

Multiple scollable elements nesting can cause unexpected experience like uncerrect cell editor position 
(keep in mind that sum of all height row must highter than scrollable element height).

```css
.reactgrid-wrapper {
    height: 100px;
    overflow: scroll;
}
```

### Example: ReactGrid component limited by height of his parent

TODO Example with content inside scrollable and top sticky pane

In this case not all of passed rows can be rendered, so scrollbar is visible and sticky pane is pinned to top of
`wrapper` class containing element. 

### Example: ReactGrid component NOT limited by height of his parent

TODO Example with content inside scrollable and top sticky pane

ReactGrid renders all of passed rows and columns, if sticky panes are passed - they are pinned directly to the egde 
of `body` element. If all of rows/column cant be rendered in viewport - virtual scrolling still works great.
