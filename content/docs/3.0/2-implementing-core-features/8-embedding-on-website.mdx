#### About ReactGrig embedding, virtual scrolling and sticky panes pinning

`ReactGrid` component isn't limited by height and width so it's behaviour can change a little bit depending on his scrollable parent element.

ReactGrid appends scroll event to his first scrollable parent and lets himself to expand to full height/width with 
continuous observing available viewport size to render the content of all ranges. 

Limiting the size of `ReactGrid` can be achieved by adding CSS class listed below 
(keep in mind that sum of rows heights must be higher than scrollable element height)

```css
.reactgrid-wrapper {
    height: 100px;
    overflow: scroll;
}
```

Multiple nested scrollable elements can cause unexpected experience like incorrect cell editor position, wrong focus location etc.

<Alert color="info" transition={{baseClass: ''}}>
	<i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle pr-2"></i>
	If all of rows/column can't be rendered in viewport - virtual scrolling still works great.
</Alert>

#### Example: ReactGrid component limited by the height of his parent

<div className={'py-4'}>
    <LimitedHeightByParentSample/>
</div>  

In this case, not all of the passed rows can be rendered, so scrollbar is visible and sticky pane is pinned directly to rhe top of the 
parent element. 

#### Example: ReactGrid component NOT limited by the height of his parent

<div className={'py-4'}>
    <NotLimitedHeightByParentSample />
</div>    

ReactGrid renders all of passed rows and columns if sticky panes are passed - they are pinned directly to the edge 
of `body` element.
