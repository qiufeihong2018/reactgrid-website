## About ReactGrig embedding, virtual scrolling and sticky panes pinning

`ReactGrid` component isn't limited by height and width so it's behavior can change a little bit depending on his scrollable parent element.

ReactGrid appends scroll event to his first scrollable parent and let's himself to expand to full height/width with 
continous observing available viewport size to render content of all ranges. 

Limiting size of `ReactGrid` can be achives basicly by add CSS class listed below 
(keep in mind that sum of rows heights must be highter than scrollable element height)

```css
.reactgrid-wrapper {
    height: 100px;
    overflow: scroll;
}
```

Multiple nested scrollable elements can cause unexpected experience like uncorrect cell editor position, wrong focus location etc.

	If all of rows/column can't be rendered in viewport - virtual scrolling still works great.
</Alert>

## Example: ReactGrid component limited by height of his parent

<div className={'py-4'}>
    <LimitedHeightByParentSample/>
</div>  

In this case not all of passed rows can be rendered, so scrollbar is visible and sticky pane is pinned directly to top of
his parant containing element. 

## Example: ReactGrid component NOT limited by height of his parent

<div className={'py-4'}>
    <NotLimitedHeightByParentSample />
</div>    

ReactGrid renders all of passed rows and columns, if sticky panes are passed - they are pinned directly to the egde 
of `body` element.
