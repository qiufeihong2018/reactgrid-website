#### Focus locations

ReactGrid has two properties related with focus location inside grid via `ReactGrid`:

1. `focusLocation`
2. `initialFocusLocation`

#### ```initialFocusLocation``` prop

You can set focus location at first render of ReactGrid. Then this prop is no more used.

```tsx
<ReactGrid
    {...props}
    initialFocusLocation={{ columnId: 'col-2', rowId: 'row-2' }} //highlight-line
/>
```

#### ```focusLocation``` prop

1. Defining `focusLocation` prop takes precedence over pointer and keyboard actions, so you have to manage it all over time. 
2. If `focusLocation` property has falsy value then is ignored. 
3. Defined `initialFocusLocation` is imidiately overrided by `focusLocation`

```tsx
<ReactGrid
    {...props}
    initialFocusLocation={{ columnId: 'col-2', rowId: 'row-2' }} //highlight-line
    focusLocation={{ columnId: 'col-2', rowId: 'row-2' }} //highlight-line
/>
```
