	This feature is only available in PRO version
</Alert>

ReactGrid supports fill handle action in PRO version, but it is disabled by default. To turn it on you have to simply
add `enableFillHandle` property to `ReactGrid` component. If you want to use autocomplete feature, add `enableAutocomplete` property.
This feature allows you to set further values to be filled in based on the data contained in the selection. Otherwise, the data is repeated
respective to the direction. Also, data isn't predicted when `ctrl` key is pressed.

```tsx
<ReactGrid
    {...props}
    enableFillHandle //highlight-line
    enableAutocomplete //highlight-line
/>
```

Note that if an incoming change will not be handled by the app, then there will be no visible changes, 
though the action was correctly performed.
