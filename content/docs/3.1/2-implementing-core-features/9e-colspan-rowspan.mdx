#### Introduction

This feature allows you to set colspan and rowspan in a cell.

#### Usage

This feature is experimental and incomplete. If you want to use it, please use only cells which type is ```header```. 
In other case, you can see strange behaviour of cells.

```tsx
...
    cells: [
      ...
      { type: "header", text: 'total', colspan: 3, rowspan: 2 },
      ...
    ]
...
```
