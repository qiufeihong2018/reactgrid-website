import { ReactGrid } from "@silevis/reactgrid";

#### Introduction

This feature disables sticky when the sum of the sizes of sticky panes overflows given breakpoint value (by default `50`).

#### Usage

1. Feature is enabled by default. If you want to change breakpoints value you can add `horizontalStickyBreakpoint` and `verticalStickyBreakpoint` property to ReactGrid component.  
In this example sticky will disable when their `width` or `height` will be more than `40%` of viewport.

```tsx
return (
  <div style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh" }}>
    <ReactGrid
      rows={rows}
      columns={columns}
      enableFullWidthHeader
      stickyLeftColumns={3}
      stickyTopRows={5}
      horizontalStickyBreakpoint={40}
      verticalStickyBreakpoint={40}
    />
  </div>
);
```
