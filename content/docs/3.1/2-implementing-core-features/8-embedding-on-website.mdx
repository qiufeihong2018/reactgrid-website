#### About ReactGrig embedding, virtual scrolling and sticky panes pinning

`ReactGrid` component isn't limited by height and width so its behaviour can change a little bit depending on its scrollable parent element.

ReactGrid appends scroll event to its immediate scrollable parent and lets itself expand to full height/width with the option of
constant observation of available viewport size.

Limiting the size of `ReactGrid` can be achieved by adding CSS class listed below 
(bear in mind that the total rows height must be bigger than scrollable element height)

```css
.reactgrid-wrapper {
    height: 100px;
    overflow: scroll;
}
```

Multiple nested scrollable elements can cause unexpected experience like incorrect cell editor position, wrong focus location etc.

<Alert color="info">
	<i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle pr-2"></i>
	If all rows/columns can't be rendered in viewport - virtual scrolling still works fine.
</Alert>

#### Example: ReactGrid component limited by the height of its parent

<div className={'py-4'}>
    {/* <LimitedHeightByParentSample/> */}
</div>  

In this case, not all the passed rows can be rendered, so scrollbar appears and sticky pane is pinned directly to the top of the 
parent element. 

#### Example: ReactGrid component NOT limited by the height of its parent

<div className={'py-4'}>
    {/* <NotLimitedHeightByParentSample /> */}
</div>    

ReactGrid renders all the passed rows and columns if sticky panes are passed - they are pinned directly to the edge 
of `body` element.
