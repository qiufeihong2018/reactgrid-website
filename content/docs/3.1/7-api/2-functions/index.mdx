#### Keycodes

Keycode related functions are commonly used by every cell template and they uses the unicode value of pressed keyboard key
(exacly like `KeyboardEvent.keyCode`).

```ts
isAlphaNumericKey(keyCode: number): boolean
```
Used in creating custom cell templates. Checks if `keycode` is alphanumeric.

```ts
inNumericKey(keyCode: number): boolean
```
Used in creating custom cell templates. Checks if `keycode` is between 0 and 9 (also on numpad).

```ts
isNumpadNumericKey(keyCode: number): boolean
```
Used in creating custom cell templates. Checks if `keycode` is between 0 and 9 on numpad.

```ts
isAllowedOnNumberTypingKey(keyCode: number): boolean
```
Used in creating custom cell templates. Checks if `keycode` is allowed while typing 
numbers (for chars like comma, dash, period).

```ts
isNavigationKey(keyCode: number): boolean
```
Used in creating custom cell templates. Checks if `keycode` is allowed for navigation 
(arrows, end, home, backspace, delete keys).

```ts
getCharFromKeyCode(keyCode: number, isShiftKey: boolean = false): boolean
```
Converts key code into char including the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key. 

#### Helpers

```ts
getCellProperty = <TCell extends Cell, TKey extends keyof TCell>(
    uncertainCell: Uncertain<TCell>,
    propName: TKey,
    expectedType: 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'undefined' | 'function' | 'object' | string
)
```
Returns cell property value. Used to create a compatible cell.

#### Enums

`keyCodes` enum contains a set of key codes + `POINTER = 1` to mark a pointer event (ReactGrid addon). 
Used in cell templates.
