#### Introduction

This feature disables sticky when the sum of the sizes of sticky panes overflows given breakpoint value (by default `50`).

#### Usage

The feature is enabled by default. If you want to change the breakpoints value you can add `horizontalStickyBreakpoint` or 
`verticalStickyBreakpoint` property to ReactGrid component.

In this example, sticky will disable when their `width` or `height` will be more than `40`% of the viewport.

```tsx
return (
  <div style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh" }}>
    <ReactGrid
      {...props}
      stickyLeftColumns={3}
      stickyTopRows={5}
      horizontalStickyBreakpoint={40} 
      verticalStickyBreakpoint={40}
    />
  </div>
);
```
