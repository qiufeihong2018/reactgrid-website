#### Introduction


import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout color="warning" transition={{baseClass: ''}}>
	This feature is experimental, incomplete and can be changed in the future.
</Callout>

This feature allows you to set colspan and rowspan in a cell. Spanned cell don't pushes the other from their origin position.
Insted, spanned cell stretches to desired size. 

#### Usage

If you want to use it, please use only cells which type is ```header```. 
The use of this type of cell results in less undesirable behavior. 
Cells that lie underneath the spanned cell should also be  marksed as ```header``` type.

```tsx
import { Row } from "@silevis/reactgrid";

const row: Row = {
    rowId: 0,
    cells: [
       { type: 'header', text: 'total', colspan: 3}, // highlight-line
       { type: 'header', text: '' }, // highlight-line
       { type: 'header', text: '' }, // highlight-line
       { type: 'text', text: 'some text'},
      // ...
    ]
}
```

#### Caveats

Currently, the span of cells plays a visual role, functionalities related to interaction will be successively implemented 
in the future.
