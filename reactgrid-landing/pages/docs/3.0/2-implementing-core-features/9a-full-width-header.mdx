#### Introduction

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout color="warning" transition={{baseClass: ''}}>
	
	Full width header feature is experimental and it can be changed in the future
</Callout>

This feature extends width of top sticky pane to full available space inside ReactGrid's parent. 

#### Usage

1. Add `enableFullWidthHeader` property to ReactGrid component and add any number of `stickyTopRows`. In our example, the sample
ReactGrid component was also wrapped inside a div element that is wider than all columns. 

```tsx
return (
    <ReactGrid
      rows={rows}
      columns={columns}
      enableFullWidthHeader // highlight-line
      stickyTopRows={1}  // highlight-line
    />
);
```

## 
#### Issues

- If the width of ReactGrid's parent is less then the sum of all the columns (including left sticky), there might be bugs
- enabling right and bottom sticky panes can cause bugs related with scrolling, ranges selection etc.
