ReactGrid has three properties related to selections inside the grid via `ReactGrid`:

1. `enableRangeSelection`
2. `enableRowSelection`
3. `enableColumnSelection`

#### ```enableRangeSelection``` property

The range selection is the most common selection, but in case you want to use it, it's necessary to enable it before.
You can do multiple selections by holding the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Command ⌘</kbd> key on Apple devices.

```tsx
<ReactGrid
    {...props}
    enableRangeSelection //highlight-line
/>
```

#### ```enableRowSelection``` and enableColumnSelection property

Way how ```enableRowSelection``` and ```enableColumnSelection``` property works is very similar.

When you first click on:
- the left cell of a row, the whole row will be selected, then you can expand this selection to other rows;
- the top cell of the column, the whole column will be selected, then you can expand this selection to other columns.

You can then select or unselect any row/column by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Command ⌘</kbd> key.

If you click on the first top-left cell and ```enableColumnSelection``` is enabled then the column has a priority 
over the row in this particular case.

```tsx
<ReactGrid
    {...props}
    enableRowSelection //highlight-line
    enableColumnSelection //highlight-line
/>
```
