ReactGrid introduces a brand new feature called *group Id*. The main purpose of it is to avoid queueing changes  
by marking cells on `groupId` property using [`Id`](/docs/3.0/7-api/1-types/4-id/) interface.

Marked cell with a `groupId` has a following behavior. While you paste data or execute fill handle action: the change will 
be queued only for a cell with the same `groupId`. If the change can't be queued, then you will be warned in browser's console.
Even if no cell is marked, then they are treated as a separate group.

Every cell with declared `groupId` renders with additional `span` element (containing its value) inside a cell if 
you have passed `enableGroupIdRender` property:

```tsx
<ReactGrid
    {...props}
    enableFillHandle
    enableRangeSelection
    enableGroupIdRender // highlight-line
/>
```

`groupId` property is available in every cell template because it's provided by [`Cell`](/docs/3.0/7-api/0-interfaces/4-cell/)
interface. 

#### Live example

An example shows that a few cells were marked with `group: A` or `group: B` *group Id*.
Try and select any range and then copy and paste or use fill handle to clone data.
